           <hr/>
           <p><a href="https://www.baseball-reference.com/register/player.fcgi?id=floria000est" target="_blank">Estevan Florial</a> is the second ranked Yankee prospect behind Justus Sheffield and is ranked 45th overall. Estevan Florial was signed out of the Dominican Republic for $200,000, a fraction of what he could have received before a birth certificate dispute, in March of 2015. He was among the top international free agents of the 2014-2015, a class that was headlined by MLB’s current top prospect, Vladimir Guerrero Jr. Florial has hit to a triple slash line (batting average / on base percentage / slugging percentage) of .281/.365/.449 with 63 doubles, 25 home runs, and 64 stolen bases throughout 4 seasons in the minors (318 games). Many scouts regard him to be a five tool player who can hit for average and power, field and throw, and run. His eye (ability to take close pitches) is what separates him from many of his peers, but he will have to learn to be more selective at the plate before he becomes the superstar many project him to be. His estimated time of arrival is 2020 as a September call up, and he is on pace to play his first full season in 2021.</p>
