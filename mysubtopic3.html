           <hr/>
           <p><a href="https://www.baseball-reference.com/players/l/loaisjo01.shtml" target="_blank">Jonathan Loaisiga</a> is the third ranked Yankee prospect behind Justus Sheffield and Estevan Florial and is ranked 66th overall. Loaisiga was signed by the San Francisco Giants in 2012 but was released despite a strong pro debut because of injuries. The Yankees then signed him in February of 2016 after he threw 95 miles per hour during a tryout. That May, he made one Class-A start before needing Tommy John Surgery. He returned for 11 starts in 2017 and showed enough promise to be added to the Yankees 40-man roster in 2018. Seven months later, Loaisiga made his major league debut as a spot starter. In 14 AAA starts in 2018, he went 6-1 with a 2.89 earned run average with a minor-league-leading 8.38 strikeouts per walk. In 24.2 major league innings, Loaisiga struggled mightily but has the potential to become a good, middle of the rotation starter and even his floor leaves him with a bullpen role.
